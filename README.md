# Term 1 - C Programming Exercises 👨‍💻

This repository contains my practice codes written in C during the first semester of my Computer Engineering degree.

## 🔧 Topics covered:
- Input / Output operations
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions
- Arrays and Strings
- Basic algorithms

## 📁 Folder structure
Each folder corresponds to a week's lessons or topics. File names describe the content or the exercise implemented.

## 📚 About
All these codes were written while I was learning the basics of programming in C. This repo serves both as a reference for myself and anyone new to C.
